# Project for ATM project.
This project is for coding test purpose.
For fullfilling the requirements, I used Django framework as a basis.
But it does not include any important RESTful API here.

## How-to

### Getting the code from github.
To clone this repository, run the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com:byoungokim/ATM_Django.git
```

### Prepare your environment.
This guide is based on python3
```bash
# It is recommended you to set up your virtual environment
source $YOUR_VIRTUAL_ENV_ACTIVATE_SCRIPT

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


```

### Run test code with your django script
```bash
python3 manage.py test
```
